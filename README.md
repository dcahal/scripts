# POSIX and BASH Shell Scripts
These are various shell scripts which I  use on my system. I also include the following tweaked versions of scripts from system packages:

## fish
Peaceful version of [asciiquarium][1]. Modified so sharks don't bite and the fish hook always misses while reeling in. Dolphin colors are consistent. Transparent background added by @UndeadLeech. 

## pastebinit
Added distro detection for KDE Neon, and changed the default site to [dpaste.com][2] because pastebin.com doesn't like requests from Docker containers or Neon systems and is a generall inferior experience.
